Is a program for when you are splitting expenses with other people and want to minimize the amount of transactions.

The idea is that if you are a set of people who woulde like to share some expenses this would be a way to calculate how much each owes one another.
Say a person covers for a subset A of the people and another person covers for a subset B of the people, then the program should be considering every possibility of whether A overlaps B, or if A is contained in B, etc.
The task is then to minimize the number of transactions so that everyone gets the amount of money they need.
